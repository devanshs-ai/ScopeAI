## 🔥 Features
- **Instant Repository Ingestion:** Paste any GitHub URL to securely clone and analyze the codebase.
- **Deep AST Analysis:** Python files are parsed using Abstract Syntax Trees to semantically separate imports, functions, and classes.
- **Intelligent Context Retrieval:** Uses `MiniLM-L6-v2` for generating 384-dimension vector embeddings and ChromaDB's HNSW graph traversal for lightning-fast semantic search.
- **AI Chat Interface:** Powered by Groq's ultra-fast LLM inference to explain code, trace logic, and answer architectural questions.
- **Ephemeral & Secure:** Repositories are cloned dynamically and purged immediately after processing. No raw source code is permanently stored.

## 🚀 Deployment Guide
ScopeAI is designed to be highly portable. Here is how the production footprint is configured:
>>>>>>> 26785b0c3ac71f371d9934ec38d7ddf9bbac3734
### 1. Backend (Hugging Face Spaces)
The backend is packaged as a Docker container to ensure all heavy C++ compiling requirements (like `hnswlib` for ChromaDB) are met.
1. Create a new **Docker** Space on Hugging Face.
2. Push the `backend/` directory using Git Subtrees from your root project:
   ```bash
   git remote add huggingface https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME
   git subtree push --prefix backend huggingface main --force
   ```
3. Add your `GROQ_API_KEY` in the **Variables and secrets** menu of your Hugging Face Space.

### 2. Frontend (Vercel)
The React/Vite frontend is deployed globally via Vercel's edge network.
1. Import the repository into Vercel.
2. Set the Root Directory to `frontend`.
3. Add the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable pointing to the Direct API URL of your Hugging Face space (e.g., `https://username-spacename.hf.space`).
4. Trigger a Deploy!
